# Prework Study Guide

## Description

My motivation for this project and the reason I built it, is so that i can have a simple, yet efficient way of not only creating a study guide for my bootcamp, but to also apply and utilize skills that will help me later on. This project has short and brief points that can help with studying, despite the fact I have minimal coding experience. I learned throughout my project that ensuring I was keeping all my branches updated, allowed for a smooth transition.

The Prework Study Guide is most easily used through Google Chrome. Each section on the webpage contains a small amount of information concerning four different topics, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Using the DevTools console on Chrome, the console will list and choose one topic for the user to study first.
